## FAQ

#### Your API key is showing...

Yes it is! I understand best practices dictacte I set my google books API key as an enviroment
 variable so people don't steal my identity and put me in jail. I chose to leave it visible just
 in case the user does not have one/ does not want to do the work of getting one. I'm sure this won't 
 backfire on me....

#### Why Python?

Well although I am more comfortable using JavaScript in general, I took this as a great opportunity to
sharpen my python skills. If I were to no get selected for this position at least I know I learned 
a lot by doing the assessment in a language I am not as comfortable with yet. 

### Can you improve your code? 

Of course not. My code is tis but beauty incarnate...
...said no programmer ever. I can, and hope I will always be able to improve my code. If my code
was a Disney movie it would be called "The Hunchback of Notre Dame falls on his face and messes it up more".
Or something like that. I feel like my code is still very dirty and I hope to get an opportunity to make it better
for the resubmission. Ideally I would love to implement OOP with classes. I realized far too late this would have
been a much cleaner approach. For now, I am proud of accomplishing the task and look forward to what comes next!
